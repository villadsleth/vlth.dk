# VagrantPress

*VagrantPress* is a packaged development environment for developing WordPress themes and modules.  
I initially created this project to aid in developing child modules for a WordPress blog.

# Prerequisites

+ [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
+ [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Getting Started

This is a fairly simple project to get up and running.  
The procedure for starting up a working WordPress is as follows:

1. Clone the project.  (Thereâ€™s only master branch.)
2. Run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater` from command line
2. Run the command `vagrant up` from the directory
3. Open your browser to http://vagrantpress.dev

## Working with the environment

To log in to the local Wordpress installation:

`http://vagrantpress.dev/wp-admin/` the username is `admin`, the password is `vagrant`.

You can access phpMyAdmin:

`http://vagrantpress.dev/phpmyadmin/` with username `wordpress`, password `wordpress`.

## A Few Details

* If you're needing a password (for anything - including mysql, it should be `vagrant`)

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

 * Have a look at the [troubleshooting guide][ts]
